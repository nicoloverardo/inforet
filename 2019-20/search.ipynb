The Democratic primary election was held on August 26, 1896 and September 9. Prior to the ratification of the 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Senators were elected by the state legislature and not through the direct election by the people of the state. However, the Democratic Party of South Carolina organized primary elections for the U.S. Senate beginning in 1896 and the General Assembly would confirm the choice of the Democratic voters. Conservative Democratic Joseph H. Earle won the Democratic primary and was elected by the General Assembly for a six-year term. \n",

The Republican Party retained the presidency, while the Democratic Party retained control of Congress. In the 1988 presidential election, Republican Vice President George H. W. Bush defeated Democratic Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts. Bush won the popular vote by just under eight points, and won 426 of the 538 electoral votes. Bush won the Republican nomination over Kansas Senator Bob Dole and televangelist Pat Robertson of Virginia. Dukakis won the Democratic nomination over Reverend Jesse Jackson of Illinois, Tennessee Senator Al Gore, and Missouri Congressman Dick Gephardt. Bush's victory remains the only time since Harry S. Truman's victory in the 1948 presidential election in which either party won more than two consecutive presidential elections. Neither the Senate nor the House saw any significant partisan change, and the Democratic Party retained control of both chambers. In the gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party picked up one governorship. \n",

      "The 1948 United States presidential election in Massachusetts took place on November 2, 1948, as part of the 1948 United States presidential election, which was held throughout all contemporary 48 states. Voters chose sixteen representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Massachusetts voted for the Democratic nominee, incumbent President Harry S. Truman of Missouri, over the Republican nominee, former Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York. Truman ran with Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky, while Dewey running mate was Governor Earl Warren of California. Truman carried the state with 54.66 percent of the vote to Dewey's 43.16 percent, a Democratic victory margin of 11.50 percent. Progressive Party candidate Henry A. Wallace came in a distant third, with 1.81 percent. As Truman narrowly won an upset victory over Dewey nationally, Massachusetts weighed in as seven percent more Democratic than the national average. Once a typical Yankee Republican bastion in the wake of the Civil War, Massachusetts had been a Democratic-leaning state since 1928, when a coalition of Irish Catholic and other ethnic immigrant voters primarily based in urban areas turned Massachusetts and neighboring Rhode Island into New England’s only reliably Democratic states. Massachusetts voted for Al Smith in 1928 and for Franklin D. Roosevelt four times in the 1930s and 1940s. Truman’s victory thus marked the Democratic Party’s sixth straight win in Massachusetts. Despite the national race being much closer, Truman in 1948 outperformed any of Franklin Roosevelt’s four victories in the state of Massachusetts. FDR had never won the state with more than a single-digit margin; Roosevelt’s largest margin of victory was by 9.46% in 1936 and he never took a vote share higher than the 53.11 percent he received in 1940. In 1944, Roosevelt carried the Bay State with 52.80 percent to Dewey’s 46.99 percent, a fairly close margin of only 5.81 percent. Truman’s victory four years later taking 54.66 percent and winning by 11.50 percent thus made 1948 the strongest showing ever by a Democratic presidential candidate in Massachusetts up to that point, a record that would stand until John F. Kennedy ran from Massachusetts in 1960. Truman would carry eight of the state’s fourteen counties, including the most heavily populated parts of the state surrounding the cities of Boston, Worcester, and Springfield. Notably, Truman flipped highly populated Middlesex County, which had not voted Democratic in any of Franklin Roosevelt’s four victories in the state, into the Democratic column. Massachusetts and neighboring Rhode Island were the only states in the Northeast to favor Truman over Dewey in 1948, the same split that had occurred in 1928. Both states had large urban Irish Catholic populations, who remained loyal Democrats in the wake of 1928, even as other groups defected back to the GOP. \n",

      "The 2016 United States presidential election in Alabama was held on November 8, 2016, as part of the 2016 General Election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia participated. Alabama voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. On March 1, 2016, in the presidential primaries, Alabama voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic, Republican, and Libertarian parties' respective nominees for president. Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated chose any one primary in which to vote. Alabama has voted for the Republican candidate in every election since it was won by Ronald Reagan in 1980. Trump was heavily favored to win the state. Donald Trump won the election in Alabama with 62.1% of the vote. Hillary Clinton received 34.4% of the vote. The state gave 60.55% of its votes to Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, meaning that it shifted about 1.5% more Republican from the previous election. \n",

      "Richard Wigginton Thompson (June 9, 1809 – February 9, 1900) was an American politician. Thompson was born in Culpeper County, Virginia. He left Virginia in 1831 and lived briefly in Louisville, Kentucky before finally settling in Lawrence County, Indiana. There, he taught school, kept a store, and studied law at night. Admitted to the bar in 1834, he practiced law in Bedford, Indiana, and served four terms in the Indiana General Assembly from 1834 to 1838. He served as President pro tempore of the Indiana Senate for a short time and briefly held the office of acting Lieutenant Governor. In the presidential election of 1840, he zealously advocated the election of William Henry Harrison. Thompson then represented Indiana in the United States Congress, serving in the United States House of Representatives from 1841 to 1843 and again from 1847 to 1849. During the 1850s Thompson and some of his fellow Whigs (such as his friend Schuyler Colfax) transferred allegiance to the American Party, better known as the Know Nothing Party. They did so due to their suspicion of the increased immigration from Ireland and Germany, but also because of the view of the northern portion of the American Party to be opposed to slavery. In time Thompson and his allies would allow an alliance of their portion of the Whig Party (which was collapsing with the American Party to prevent victories in elections by the Democratic Party. In the election of 1860 Thompson was his state's leader of those who organized the Constitutional Union Party. At the May convention, Indiana first supported John McLean, but fell in behind John Bell on the second ballot. Thompson was placed on the National Committee, but gave up the on third party strategy in August and supported Abraham Lincoln so as not to risk a Democratic victory in Indiana. Following the American Civil War, Thompson served as judge of the 18th Circuit Court of the state of Indiana from 1867 to 1869. Active in Republican politics, he was the Platform Committee chairman at the 1868 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he offered Vice President Schuyler Colfax's name for renomination at the 1872 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, and gave the nominating speech for Oliver H. P. Morton for President at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati. In 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed him Secretary of the Navy; and he held that office until December 1880. \n",

      "A dry state is a state in the United States in which the manufacture, distribution, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages are prohibited or tightly restricted. While some states, such as North Dakota, entered the United States as dry states, others went dry after passage of prohibition legislation. Currently, no state in the United States remains completely dry, but some states contain dry counties. Prior to the adoption of nationwide prohibition in 1920, state legislatures in the United States passed local option laws that allowed a county or township to go dry if it chose to do so. The Maine law, passed in 1851 in Maine, was among the first statutory implementations of the developing temperance movement in the United States. Following Maine's lead, prohibition laws were soon passed in the states of Delaware, Ohio, Illinois, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New York; however, all but one were repealed. The debate over prohibition increased in the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as the drys, including the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), the National Prohibition Party, the Anti-Saloon League, and others, continued to support temperance and prohibition legislation, while the wets opposed it. By 1913 nine states had statewide prohibition and 31 others had local option laws, placing more than 50 percent of the United States population under some form of alcohol prohibition. Following two unsuccessful attempts at national prohibition legislation (one in 1913 and the other in 1915), Congress approved a resolution on December 19, 1917, to prohibit the manufacture, sale, transportation, and importation of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The resolution was sent to the states for ratification and became the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. On January 8, 1918, Mississippi became the first state to ratify the amendment and on January 16, 1919, Nebraska became the 36th state to do so, securing its passage with the required three-fourths of the states. By the end of February 1919, only three states remained as hold-outs to ratification: New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The National Prohibition Act, also known as the Volstead Act, was enacted on October 18, 1919. Prohibition in the United States went into effect on January 17, 1920. Nationwide prohibition was repealed in 1933 with the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment on February 20 and its ratification on December 5. \n",

Together they compose the national legislature of the United States. The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution. The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census, with each district entitled to one representative. Since its inception in 1789, all representatives have been directly elected. The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435. As of the 2010 Census, the largest delegation is that of California, with fifty-three representatives. Seven states have only one representative: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation, known as bills, which, after concurrence by the Senate, are sent to the president for consideration. In addition to this basic power, the House has certain exclusive powers, among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue; the impeachment of federal officers, who are sent to trial before the Senate; and, in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president, the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office, with one vote given to each state for that purpose. The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol. The presiding officer is the speaker of the House, who is elected by the members thereof (and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party). The speaker and other floor leaders are chosen by the Democratic Caucus or the Republican Conference, depending on whichever party has more voting members. \n",

The general election in Scotland was fought in the aftermath of the 2016 Scottish Parliament election in which the SNP won a third term in government but lost their overall majority in the Scottish Parliament. At that election, the Scottish Conservatives increased their number of MSPs, overtaking Labour as the largest opposition party. The 2016 EU referendum was held a month later on Thursday, 23 June and the final result was for the United Kingdom to Leave the EU; despite Scotland voting 62.0% Remain. Negotiations are due to begin shortly since invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union in March 2017, which was expected to dominate the snap general election campaign. In line with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election had not been due until 7 May 2020, but a call for a snap election by Prime Minister Theresa May received the necessary two-thirds majority in a 522-13 vote in the House of Commons on 19 April 2017. The Conservative Party, which has governed since 2010, was defending a majority of 17 against the Labour Party, the official opposition. The third-largest party was the Scottish National Party (SNP), which won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at the 2015 general election. The election resulted in the SNP remaining as the largest single party in Scotland despite losing 21 seats to pro-union candidates. This marked a 13% drop in support for the SNP, down to 36.9% of the vote. The Conservatives doubled their share of vote, up to 28.6%, and won 13 seats, while Labour won 7 seats and the Liberal Democrats won 4 seats. The Conservatives recorded their best result in Scotland since 1983 (in terms of seats won) or 1979 (in terms of share of the popular vote). Until this election, the Conservatives had not been the second-largest party in Scotland since 1992 and had not been the largest unionist party in Scotland since 1955. Defeated SNP MPs included: former SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond, SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson, SNP Chief Whip Mike Weir; as well as John Nicolson and Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh. Commentators suggested that the election might reduce the SNP's case for a second referendum on Scottish independence. Following the election, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that her party's plans for a second referendum were 'undoubtedly' a factor in the election results. The SNP also abandoned its fundraiser for a possible referendum after raising only half of its £1, 000, 000 target, just over a week before its preset deadline. \n",

      "The Hunting Party is the sixth studio album by American rock band Linkin Park. The album, produced by band members Mike Shinoda and Brad Delson, was released by Warner Bros. Records and Machine Shop on June 13, 2014. It is the first album since Meteora (2003) not to be produced with Rick Rubin, after producing the band's previous three studio albums. The title The Hunting Party is a contextual metaphor: Linkin Park is the party that is hunting to bring back the energy and soul of rock. The Hunting Party is a departure from the electronic rock sound of the band's previous two studio albums, A Thousand Suns (2010) and Living Things (2012). The album, described by Shinoda as simply \"a rock record\", serves a statement by the band against contemporary mainstream and active rock bands, accused by him as \"trying to be other bands and playing it safe\". Packaged by an artwork by Brandon Parvini based on an original drawing by James Jean, the album took under a year to record and produce, with material being improvisationally written by the band. The album also features guest appearances from Helmet's Page Hamilton, System of a Down's Daron Malakian, Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello, and Rakim, marking the first time Linkin Park has collaborated with other artists on a studio album. The album was promoted by the band and Warner Bros, with multiple promotional teasers and interviews produced and published in the lead-up to the album's release and listening parties of the album being held worldwide on multiple dates. The band embarked on the Carnivores Tour, a double-headline tour with Thirty Seconds to Mars, as well as The Hunting Party Tour, in support of the album. Five singles from The Hunting Party have been released; \"Guilty All the Same\" in March 2014, \"Until It's Gone\" in May 2014, and \"Wastelands\", \"Rebellion\" and \"Final Masquerade\" in June 2014. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its return to the heavier rock sound of their older albums. It debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, and has placed at number four on Revolvers list of \"The 20 Best Albums of 2014\". The album was certified Platinum in United States for the sales of one million copies. \n",

      "John O'Brien (20 January 1922 – 21 September 1982) was a leading figure on the far right of British politics during the early 1970s. John O'Brien was born in Shropshire in 1922. He was educated at St. Peter's College in Birmingham before beginning work as a publicity copywriter and served for five years in the REME during the Second World War. After the war, he spent some time in industry before returning to Shropshire where he ran his own horticultural business. A fruit farmer by trade, O'Brien had initially been a member of the Conservative Party in Shrewsbury. A supporter of Enoch Powell, he attempted to organise a 'Powell for Premier' movement following the Rivers of Blood speech. When this failed to get off the ground he briefly joined the National Democratic Party before emerging as a member of the National Front. O'Brien gained a reputation for working towards unity on the far right, establishing contacts not only with the NDP, but also the Monday Club, the Union Movement, the Integralists led by white Russian George Knuppfer and a number of local anti-immigration groups, with the NF ultimately absorbing a number of such groups. Following internal wranglings within the party, O'Brien was appointed leader of the NF in 1970, following the resignation and removal of A. K. Chesterton (who had brought O'Brien in to be NF Office Manager). Initially seen as a compromise candidate (after the rebellion against Chesterton, no one was willing to take the post), he soon set about trying to modernise the party and clashed with John Tyndall and Martin Webster over the issue, who had backed the O'Brien candidacy because they thought erroneously that he could be easily manipulated. The simmering conflict came to a head when O'Brien accused Webster of working with the Northern League, which had been proscribed in the NF. O'Brien moved to expel Webster but failed to get Tyndall's backing leading to open conflict. During the resulting struggle O'Brien briefly departed from the scene to go on honeymoon and during his absence the pro-Tyndall contingent made moves to expel a number of his supporters. O'Brien and his supporters, appalled at the extent to which a small neo-Nazi clique around Tyndall had taken over most of the facets of the party, failed to win the struggle and left to join John Davis' National Independence Party as a group. Although the NIP initially looked like it might challenge the NF, Tyndall's party was galvanised by the arrival in Britain of Uganda's Asian population, who had been expelled by Idi Amin. The opposition to their resettlement in the UK gave the better-known NF a boost and meant that the NIP failed to gain any momentumalthough they famously beat former Tory candidate turned National Front candidate Roy Painter in Tottenham at the February 1974 General Election (despite his campaign enjoying a campaign-diary spot during the election with The Guardian)and struggled on until 1976, when it was closed down. O'Brien did not return to the political arena after this although he contributed to the British nationalist journal Candour. He died suddenly on 21 September 1982. The former leader of the NF can claim to have made one of the most significant blows against neo-Nazism in post-war Britain. His involvement with the This Week documentary on ITV about the NF (Thames Television, ITV, September 1974where he was also interviewed at length about the party he left whilst its chairman) caused immense damage to the National Front and instigated fury within the party's ordinary membership that they had not been made aware as to the full extent of the neo-Nazi pasts and continuing links of the likes of Tyndall and Martin Webster.Within one month of the broadcast, Tyndall was fired as NF Chairman. O'Brien should not be confused with the John O'Brien involved with the White Nationalist Party, as the latter is still alive. \n",

      "The 1968 presidential campaign of Richard Nixon, the 36th Vice President of the United States, began when Nixon, the Republican nominee of 1960, formally announced his candidacy, following a year's preparation and five years' political reorganization after defeats in the 1960 presidential election and the 1962 California gubernatorial election. En route to the Republican Party's presidential nomination, Nixon faced challenges from Governor George Romney of Michigan, Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, Governor Ronald Reagan of California, and Senator Charles Percy of Illinois. Nixon won nine of the thirteen state primaries held that season, although due to the population of his state, Governor Reagan won the popular vote while carrying only California. These victories, along with pledged delegate support from states not holding primaries, secured Nixon the nomination on the first ballot of the Republican National Convention, where he named Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as his running mate. In the general election, Nixon emphasized \"law and order\", positioning himself as the champion of what he called the \"silent majority\". Running well ahead of his opponent, incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey, his support slipped in the polls following his refusal to partake in presidential debates, and following an announcement from President Lyndon B. Johnson that a halt in the bombing of Vietnam had been negotiated. Winning a close election on November 5, 1968, Nixon and Agnew were inaugurated as the 37th President of the United States and 39th Vice President of the United States, respectively, on January 20, 1969. He was the first Vice President since Martin Van Buren in 1836 to be elected President without first having succeeded to that office through the death of the previous President, and is to date the only one to be so elected while not an incumbent. \n",

The by-election was held during World War II, and five of the largest political parties – Conservative, Labour, Liberal, National Labour and National Liberal agreed to an electoral pact not to contest any by-elections in seats held by any of the other parties. The British Union of Fascists (BUF) had contested several recent by-elections, receiving very few votes. During the mid-1930s, the group had been able to organise sizeable demonstrations, but anti-fascist activity and the banning of political uniforms by the Public Order Act 1936 had hit the group hard. The BUF's main message was to call for immediate peace and a pact with the Axis powers; during the \"phoney war\" period this message had been received calmly. The British Union selected Frederick Haslam, who was 43 years old and working as an engineering designer. Haslam had served in France and Palestine during World War I and had won the Military Medal when fighting on the Somme. However, by the time that the Middleton and Prestwich campaign started, the British Army was fighting the Germans in Norway; on 9 May, the Germans invaded France through the Low Countries. The sudden escalation in the war made the BUF seem like fifth columnists, and the seizure of power in Norway by Vidkun Quisling was a matter of extreme concern because Quisling's career was superficially similar to that of Oswald Mosley. When Mosley spoke in Middleton and Prestwich, missiles were thrown at him and people tried to hit him. The British government was also preparing to make the BUF illegal under wartime powers, and arrested several Fascist activists in the run-up to the election. Nairne Stewart Sandeman had held the seat for the Conservative Party since the 1923 general election, and had won more than 60% of the vote in the 1935 general election against a Labour Party challenge. The party chose Ernest Gates to contest the by-election. With only Fascist opposition, the election was expected to be an easy win for Gates. Gates won resoundingly, with 98.7% of the votes cast and a 97.4% majority: an all-time record for any contested UK parliamentary by-election, and the largest majority in any parliamentary election since East Kerry in the 1885 general election. The BUF was banned the day after the election, and its remaining leaders interned. \n",

The county is named for John Randolph, a U.S. senator from Virginia influential in obtaining congressional approval of the Louisiana Purchase, which includes today's Randolph County. Created as Arkansas's 32nd county on October 29, 1835, Randolph County has two incorporated cities, including Pocahontas, the county seat and most populous city. The county is also the site of numerous unincorporated communities and ghost towns. Crossed by five rivers, most of Randolph County contains foothills and valleys typical of the Ozarks. However, the eastern side of the county is largely flat with fertile soils typical of the Delta, with the Black River roughly dividing the regions. The county contains three protected areas: two Wildlife Management Areas and Davidsonville Historic State Park, which preserves and interprets an early pioneer settlement. Other historical features such as log cabins, one-room school houses, community centers, and museums describe the history and culture of Randolph County. Randolph County occupies and contained a population of 17, 969 people in 7, 299 households as of the 2010 Census, ranking it 38th in size and 41st in population among the state's 75 counties. The economy is largely based on agriculture and small manufacturing. Poverty and unemployment rates are above national averages, but steady. Household incomes are below state and national averages. Politically, Randolph County has transitioned from reliably Democratic to steadily Republican since the mid-20th century. Randolph County is served by two school districts, Pocahontas School District and Maynard School District, and parts of three others. Higher education is provided at Black River Technical College, a public two-year community college in Pocahontas. Five Rivers Medical Center in Pocahontas is a community hospital providing primary care in the county. Although no Interstate highways serve Randolph County, the county has access to three United States highways (U.S. Route 62 [US 62], US 67, and US 412) and eleven Arkansas state highways. Randolph County is also served by one public owned/public use general aviation airport, Pocahontas Municipal Airport, and six community water systems provide potable water to customers in the county. \n",

He was a member of the Washington House of Representatives, representing the 13th Legislative District. On September 21, 2018, Manweller was asked by party leaders to resign his position in the Washington State House of Representatives after it became widely known that he had had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, a former high school student of his. Manweller’s employment as a tenured professor was terminated by Central Washington University on August 14, 2018 after an investigation by an independent third party hired by CWU to evaluate accusations of inappropriate behavior made by former students. On December 11, 2017, Manweller was placed on administrative leave by Central Washington University, following additional complaints from ex-students. CWU investigated Manweller for \"inappropriate conduct.\" The Seattle Times has additionally reported on a complaint from a Legislative Aide in Olympia, WA. In spite of CWU's suspension, Manweller filed for reelection in May 2018. According to NW News Network (Regional Public Journalism), on December 14, 2017 Manweller \"resigned his leadership position\" as assistant floor leader and was \" 'removed' from his position as the Ranking Republican on the House Labor and Workplace Standards Committee\" Manweller was focused on creating a smaller, less expensive, more efficient government that provides solution-oriented leadership. Most recently his efforts prioritized the move against a state income tax, increasing funding for vocational education, reducing forest fires, and stopping school shootings. Manweller was recognized often during his first years in office: * in 2017 for his work on career and technical education * in 2017 when elected as chair of the Select Committee on Pension Policy * in 2016 when chosen for minority leadership * in 2016 when qualified as a Champion of Worker Rights * in 2016 when presented The State Historic Preservation Officer's 2016 Annual Award During his 3 terms, Matt Manweller was outspoken about controversial topics such as free speech on college campuses, gender identity in regards to bathrooms, and the Washington State Supreme Court. Manweller received his Ph.D. from the University of Oregon and was a Professor of Political Science at Central Washington University. He was initially investigated by CWU in 2012, the year he was first elected to the legislature, on claims of sexual harassment by students while teaching. He obtained a restraining order against the university to prevent release of the 2012 report; the order was lifted four days before election day. In both 2012 and 2013, outside investigators concluded that there was \"evidence to suggest\" that Manweller violated the university's sexual-harassment policies. While the university did not punish him following the 2012 investigation, in 2013 Manweller's promotion to full professor was delayed and he was ordered to complete sexual harassment training. \n",

      "The 2001–02 season was Manchester United's tenth season in the Premier League and their 27th consecutive season in the top division of English football. The second full season of the new millennium was rather dismal for the Red Devils in comparison to the previous three years. The club finished in third place in the Premier League, their lowest finish in the history of the Premier League, and they were knocked out of the FA Cup in the fourth round. League Cup success was not expected, and the club duly obliged by playing what was effectively a reserve team against a strong Arsenal side in the third round. United's best success in the 2001–02 season came in the UEFA Champions League, in which they reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by Bayer Leverkusen on away goals. Ultimately, United's failure to win anything boiled down a dismal run of form in November and early December when they suffered five defeats in seven league games, including three defeats in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham United in December. They also lost six home games in the Premier League, their worst home record since the 1977–78 season. They only lost three more league games all season, but that terrible form earlier in the campaign counted against United for the rest of the campaign and they finished 10 points behind champions Arsenal (who sealed their crown by beating United 1–0 at Old Trafford in the penultimate game of the season) and three points behind runners-up Liverpool. Before the season began, Sir Alex Ferguson had announced his intention to retire from football at the end of the season, and the club began the process of trying to find a successor for the most successful manager in their history. However, Fergie went back on his decision to retire, many people citing his failure to win the Champions League in his home town of Glasgow as the reason for this reversal. Assistant manager Steve McClaren left the club before the start of the season to become the manager of Middlesbrough. Youth team coach and former player Mike Phelan was promoted to first-team coach and took over some of the assistant manager's responsibilities, but McClaren was not replaced until the summer of 2002, when Carlos Queiroz was appointed the new assistant manager. Winger Ryan Giggs was honoured with a testimonial match against Celtic, having now been at United for more than a decade. £19 million striker Ruud van Nistelrooy did what was expected of him by scoring 36 goals in all competitions and collecting the PFA Player of the Year award, but £28.1 million national record signing Juan Sebastián Verón was a major disappointment in midfield, though it was in defence where United were at their weakest following the shock departure of Jaap Stam to Lazio just after the start of the season, and the surprise acquisition of 35-year-old Frenchman Laurent Blanc as his successor. 2001–02 was the final season at Old Trafford for veteran players Denis Irwin and Ronny Johnsen after 12 and six years at the club respectively. Also on the way out of the club were goalkeeper Raimond van der Gouw and striker Dwight Yorke. Striker Andy Cole left United after seven years when he sealed a transfer to Blackburn Rovers at the end of December. \n",

      "Wilhelm Karpenstein (born 24 May 1903 in Frankfurt am Main – died 2 May 1968 in Lauterbach, Hesse) was a German Nazi Party politician. He served as Gauleiter of Pomerania during the early days of the Third Reich. Karpenstein was elected to the Reichstag in the 1930 election and served as a Nazi Party deputy until the end of the Second World War. He was appointed the party's Gauleiter in Pomerania in 1931. Immediately after the Nazis came to power a significant amount of autonomy lay with the gauleiters and their radicalism threatened to disrupt the relationship between Adolf Hitler and the middle classes that had helped to ensure his election. Karpenstein was one of the few who did not offer this problem as he was conservative and pro-middle class. Nevertheless, he did not miss the opportunity to increase his personal power in the early days of Nazism and sought to make all of the churches, government officials and media outlets in Pomerania answerable to him directly. Karpenstein however, despite not holding left-wing economic ideas, was too weak to control the dissident sentiments emerging from the Sturmabteilung in Pomerania, which was one of their power bases. As a result, Karpenstein was one of those to be purged during the Night of the Long Knives, although his lack of direct involvement with the SA meant that he was not killed but rather sacked in favour of Franz Schwede-Coburg. Ostensibly however Karpenstein was dismissed for his supposed links to Gregor Strasser and his failure to work with Hermann Göring. \n",

      "John Richard Anthony Oldfield (5 July 1899 – 11 December 1999) was a British landowner and politician. The son of Major H.E. Oldfield of the Royal Field Artillery, his father was killed in action two days before his first birthday during the Second Anglo-Boer War. With his widowed mother, he moved home many times, spending much time at Doddington Place Gardens, Kent, which had been purchased by his grandfather and aunt in 1906. Educated at Eton College, Oldfield was commissioned as an officer in the Grenadier Guards in the latter stages of the First World War. In 1920, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, he converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism. He also took an interest in social matters, and began voluntary work at Toynbee Hall in the East End of London and joined the Labour Party in the early 1920s. At the 1929 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament for South East Essex. With the formation of the Second Labour Government he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Air, Lord Thomson. Thomson was killed when the R101 airship crashed on its maiden voyage in October 1930, and Oldfield returned to the backbenches. With the formation of a National Government in August 1931, the parliamentary Labour Party was divided into two factions, with supporters of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald forming the National Labour Organisation and the remaining MPs moving to the opposition benches. Oldfield chose to join the latter group, and when a general election was held in October 1931, was defeated along with most of his Labour colleagues. He attempted to regain the seat in 1935 without success. Earlier in 1931, Oldfield had been elected to the London County Council to represent Whitechapel and St George's. He remained a member of the council until 1958, later representing Stepney and was vice chairman in 1954–1955. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Oldfield attempted to rejoin the armed forces, but was initially rejected due to his age. He eventually succeeded in enlisting as an able seaman in the Royal Navy. He finished the war with the rank of sub-lieutenant. In 1953, he married Jonnet Elizabeth Richards, and the couple moved to Doddington, Kent. There he created a mushroom farm while his wife worked on the gardens of Doddington Place. In 1964, he joined the Conservative Party and was elected to Kent County Council in the following year. He remained on the council until 1981. He died in Doddington aged 100 in December 1999, 68 years after leaving the House of Commons. He was the last surviving MP to have served during the reign of George V (1910-1936). \n",

In the 1980s, in the wake of the Oneida I (1974) decision permitting tribes to pursue such claims in federal courts, several tribes challenged such conveyances as contrary to the Proclamation. However, the Second Circuit has held that Congress had neither the authority nor the intent to prohibit such purchases within the borders of individual states, and thus that the Proclamation applied only to the federal territories. \n",

Colefax was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, and was the son of J S Colefax, a woollen merchant. He was initially educated at Bradford Grammar School before studying natural science and chemistry at the University of Strasbourg, and at Merton and Christ Church Colleges at the University of Oxford. In 1894 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and quickly became an acknowledged expert on patent law. He was made a King's Counsel in 1912. At the January 1910 general election he was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester South West, benefiting from a split in anti-Conservative vote between the Social Democratic Federation and Liberal candidates. He held the seat for less than a year, and was defeated at ensuing election in December. Much of his work was involved in Anglo-German patents, but this was ended by outbreak of the First World War. He became head of the scientific department of the Ministry of Munitions for the duration of the war. He was knighted for his wartime services in 1920. In 1918 he was appointed as solicitor-general of the County Palatine of Durham, becoming Chancellor of the Chancery Court of the Palatine in 1930. These offices had been almost entirely ceremonial since 1837. In 1901 he married Sibyl Halsey, and they had two sons. Sibyl Colefax was to become a renowned interior designer.

Finnegan was born in Chicago and graduated with a BA from Loyola University Chicago and a law degree from the DePaul University School of Law in 1930. He started practicing as an attorney in 1931 and then served as an Assistant State's attorney in Cook County. Later, Finnegan served as the Assistant Corporation Counsel for Chicago. Finnegan unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the position of a Chicago municipal court judge in 1939. In 1960, Finnegan was elected to Congress from Illinois' 12th district. After redistricting, Finnegan's district was merged with the neighboring 9th District of fellow Democrat Sidney Yates. Finnegan transferred to the 9th, since Yates was giving up his seat to run for the United States Senate. Yates lost, and Chicago's machine bosses persuaded Finnegan to stand down in 1964 and hand the 9th back to Yates. In return for his co-operation, Finnegan was appointed as a judge for the Circuit Court of Cook County. He resigned his seat in Congress on December 6, 1964 and commenced his service on the bench the following day. He continued to serve until his death in 1971. \n",

In 1946 he entered local politics when he was elected to both Stoke Newington Borough Council and the London County Council. He served as Mayor of Stoke Newington for 1947-49. He made four unsuccessful attempts to enter the House of Commons. At the 1950 and 1951 general elections he stood at Hornsey and at the 1955 general election at Taunton. His final attempt was at the 1956 Taunton by-election, when he fell 657 votes short of a majority over the Conservative winner, Edward du Cann. He moved to Suffolk and became a member of East Suffolk County Council. He was created a life peer on 10 May 1965 taking the title Baron Wells-Pestell, of Combs in the County of Suffolk. He had married Irene Wells in 1935, and combined their surnames in his title, also taking the name of the Suffolk village in which he lived.

      "Dan Leckie (1949 – May 30, 1998) was a Canadian politician, who served on Toronto City Council from 1994 to 1997. Born in Sarnia, Ontario, he studied political science at the University of Toronto. After graduating, he ran for a seat on the Toronto District School Board in the 1972 election, winning the seat and serving on that body until 1978. He was chair of the board in the final year of his term. He then served as a policy advisor in the office of mayor John Sewell. After Sewell's defeat in the 1980 election, Leckie ran as an Ontario New Democratic Party candidate for St. George in the 1981 provincial election, but lost to Susan Fish of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. He then worked in the offices of MP Dan Heap from 1981 to 1986, and city councillor Jack Layton from 1986 to 1991. In the 1991 municipal election, he was campaign manager for Layton's unsuccessful run for Mayor of Toronto. When Heap announced in 1991 that he would not run for reelection in the 1993 election, Leckie was considered a possible new NDP candidate for his seat in Trinity—Spadina. He did not run, but was instead campaign manager for Winnie Ng. Leckie ran for the Ward 5 seat on Toronto City Council in the 1994 municipal election. Early in his term, he faced criticism from budget chief Tom Jakobek when he used a $10, 000 surplus from the office budget of his predecessor Liz Amer to hire temporary staff for his office in the first month of his term; although this use of the funds was entirely legal according to the city budget rules, Jakobek called the expense unfair because not all new councillors had similar budget surpluses available to them, and vowed to change the budget allocation rules to prevent such spending in the future. While serving on council, Leckie championed environmental initiatives, opposed the expansion of the Toronto Island Airport, supported proposals to replace the Gardiner Expressway with a tunnel to enable redevelopment of Toronto's waterfront, and was an active opponent of the municipal amalgamation of Toronto proposal in 1997. Following the municipal amalgamation, Leckie did not run for reelection to the new \"megacity\" council in the 1997 municipal election, instead taking a position as chair of the Toronto Atmospheric Fund. On May 25, 1998, he suffered an aneurysm and collapsed, and remained in hospital until his death on May 30. In 2002, Toronto City Council passed a motion formally renaming part of Portland Street (from Queen's Wharf Road to Queen's Quay) in the city as Dan Leckie Way. \n",

He made his League debut against Bury in December 1921. He was an ever-present during the 1924–25 season, and went on to make 548 senior appearances for the Hammers, a record that wasn't beaten until Bobby Moore surpassed it in 1973. He scored a total of 166 goals, placing him third in the club's all-time records, above many of West Ham's finest strikers despite his role on the left wing. He was the club's top scorer for the 1927–28 and 1934–35 seasons, although he didn't score a single goal during the 1921–22, 1932–33 and 1936–37 seasons. In 1923, he was part of the team that contested the first FA Cup Final to be staged at Wembley Stadium, known as The White Horse Final. In April 1926 he made his England international debut in a 1–0 defeat by Scotland in Manchester. He played for England on another five occasions, but saw competition from the likes of Cliff Bastin, Eric Brook and Eric Houghton for the left-wing spot. Ruffell left the east London club in 1937. He joined Aldershot for a short spell, where he made two League appearances and played his final game against Port Vale. His brother Bill was also a professional footballer who had been on the books at West Ham and played League football for Nelson during the 1927–28 season. \n",

      "Manifesto was an American rock band from Washington, D.C., United States, featuring Michael Hampton (vocals, guitar, drum programming), Bert Queiroz (bass) and Ivor Hanson (drums). It was formed in 1988 after the demise of Hampton's previous short-lived bands, Embrace and One Last Wish. The trio's recording debut was the 7-inch single \"Burn\", released in 1988 on Skip Groff's Y&T Records. In 1992, they released their self-titled and only studio album through British independent record label Fire Records. The following year, shortly after their album was released in the United States, Manifesto disbanded. In contrast to the hardcore punk—indebted sound of Hampton's previous bands, Manifesto features a poppier sound, taking influences from guitar and jangle pop groups of the 1980s. As a result, the band worked with producer John A. Rivers, who produced for various British guitar pop bands such as Close Lobsters and the Pastels, on its debut album. \n",

      "Alexander George Gillon (23 December 1909 – 25 August 2007) was a civic and sporting administrator in Melbourne, Australia. He was most notable as the longest-serving president of the Victorian Football Association, and as a mayor of the City of Brunswick. Gillon was born in Broadmeadows in north-western Melbourne. He played Australian rules football when he was young, and at his peak played 88 games for the Brunswick Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) during the 1930s, where he was part of Brunswick's 1938 premiership team. He was cleared to Coburg in May 1939 and played there for one season. After World War II, Gillon took a position on the Brunswick Football Club committee. He served as a club delegate on the VFA Board of Management from 1949 until 1953. Then in February 1954, he successfully challenged Lewis Page for presidency of the VFA. When Gillon took on the presidency, the VFA was in decline and struggling badly compared with the strong position it had enjoyed during the 1940s: crowds were declining due to the abandoning of the popular throw pass rule in 1950, various social and demographic changes in post-war Melbourne were reducing crowds and revenues, and the Association board was suffering from factional fighting as a result of the fall-out from the changes. Gillon soon provided strong leadership, which largely re-unified the Association's board, and the Association began to recover from a situation which threatened its viability. One of the first challenges Gillon faced during his presidency was grounds control, as there were several bids by other football codes during the 1950s, and then by Victorian Football League (VFL) clubs during the 1960s, to take over the tenancy of VFA grounds; Gillon refused to compromise on the VFA's requirement that clubs had sole winter use of their grounds, which cost Prahran (temporarily) and Moorabbin (permanently) their places in the Association, but it set a strong example that the VFA was prepared to defend itself against stronger opponents, a trait which Gillon carried throughout his presidency. Gillon then oversaw the introduction of Sunday football in 1960, the early 1960s expansion of the Association into the outer suburbs to overcome post-war demographic shifts in the inner suburbs, and the partitioning of the VFA into two divisions in 1961; and after the VFA secured weekly television coverage from 1967, the VFA enjoyed one of its most successful periods ever during the 1970s. Also under Gillon's presidency, however, the VFA's relationship with the VFL soured, culminating in the VFA's expulsion in 1970 from the Australian National Football Council (of which Gillon had served as vice-president during the late 1960s) and a lingering adversarial relationship between the competitions which lasted until the 1980s. When asked about his relationship with the VFL on television during the 1970s, Gillon replied \"I don't hate the VFL; I'm just pro-VFA.\" Gillon went on to become the VFA's longest-serving president, serving unopposed for 27 seasons from 1954 until 1980, and exceeding the 25-year tenure of J. G. Aikman (1903–1928). In 1981, with the VFA's success of the 1970s beginning to wane and many clubs believing a new direction was required, Gillon was challenged for the presidency and defeated by Alan Wickes. Five years later, Gillon returned as part of the Football Organisation Review Team (FORT), which was formed in 1986 by Wickes' successor, Brook Andersen, to develop a new strategy for the VFA in a changing Victorian football market; the FORT's controversial report, which sought to rationalise the VFA to 12 teams, was rejected by the clubs but was instrumental in shaping the natural contraction of the VFA in the late 1980s. Outside football, Gillon served a long career in local government. In 1954, he was elected to the council of the City of Brunswick. He was a justice of the peace and a one-time vice-chairman of the Board of Works, before serving as the mayor of Brunswick. Gillon's effectiveness as a civic administrator was well regarded, and he was twice appointed by the State Government to serve as the commissioner of a city outside Brunswick. His first appointment occurred in November 1976, when the 12-man Sunshine council was sacked by the state government due to its financial mismanagement, having left the city $1, 700, 000 in deficit; Gillon served as the state-appointed commissioner of the City of Sunshine until early 1982, successfully restoring its finances to the point that an elected council could be restored to the city. Later in 1982, the Richmond council was dismissed by the state government following a report which revealed allegations of electoral malpractice and fraud, and Gillon was appointed by the state as commissioner of the City of Richmond, serving in that role until 1988. For his services to the Brunswick Football Club and the Brunswick Council, the Brunswick Football Ground was renamed the A. G. Gillon Oval in his honour in early 1976. The annual award for the best and fairest player in the VFA Thirds competition (specifically for Division 1 in years when the competition was partitioned) was named the A. G. Gillon Medal in his honour. He was also appointed OBE in the 1976 New Year Honours and a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 1987 Australia Day Honours. \n",

      "Louise Lanctôt (born March 24, 1947) is a Canadian convicted kidnapper and writer. Born Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Lanctôt is a political activist for the cause of Quebec independence from Canada. Louise Lanctôt was an active member of the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale political party that later merged with the Parti Québécois. She was also a member of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) and is the sister of convicted kidnapper Jacques Lanctôt, and was married to Jacques Cossette-Trudel who joined the FLQ with her. During what became known as the October Crisis, as a member of the Liberation Cell, on October 5, 1970, Louise Lanctôt along with her brother Jacques Lanctôt, Yves Langlois, Nigel Hamer, and Marc Carbonneau put their plans into action. They carried out an armed abduction of James Cross, the British Trade Commissioner to Canada, from his Montreal home as part of their violent attempt to overthrow the elected government and to establish a socialist Quebec state independent of Canada. On October 10, Chenier Cell leader Paul Rose and his brother, Jacques Rose along with Bernard Lortie and Francis Simard, kidnapped and then murdered Quebec Vice Premier and Cabinet Minister Pierre Laporte. Believing many others would follow in an uprising, the goal of the FLQ was to create an independent state based on the ideals of Fidel Castro's Cuba. Lanctôt, with the help of her husband and other members of the \"Liberation Cell, \" held James Cross hostage, taking his photo and sending it to police with a list of demands that included money and the release of other convicts. They advised authorities that Cross would be executed and further threats to Cross' life were delivered to several radio stations along with their demands. Early in December 1970, police discovered the location of Louise Lanctôt and her fellow kidnappers holding James Cross. His release was negotiated and on December 3, 1970, Lanctôt with her husband and child, plus the three other known members of her cell, were granted their request for safe passage to Cuba by the Government of Canada after approval by Castro. Although Lanctôt and her friends who wanted to go to Cuba were exiled from Canada for life, they were later found in France. For four years, Louise Lanctôt lived in La Courneuve in Île-de-France. Over the years, all of the Front de libération du Québec members wanted to return to Canada and began secret negotiations through the reigning government Parti Québécois to achieve that goal. On October 13, 1977, Quebec Premier René Lévesque announced he was considering a request for a pardon for Louise Lanctôt and her husband. Eventually, the federal government consented. On her return to Montreal on December 13, she pleaded guilty at trial and was sentenced to two years in jail for her part in the kidnapping. She was freed on parole after serving eight months, following which she received Quebec government financial assistance (just as any other citizen is eligible for) to attend the Université du Québec à Montréal, where she received a degree in communications in 1982 and continued on to doctoral studies in human sciences. Divorced from her husband, during the times when the Parti Québécois has been in government, she has been employed by numerous Quebec government-funded institutions, including as a researcher for the Collège de Maisonneuve, the Université du Québec à Montréal, Sainte-Justine Hospital, Université de Montréal health administration department, and the \"Ordre des infirmières et infirmiers du Québec\". The author of several books, Louise Lanctôt is a member of the Quebec Writers Union. \n",

The company was established in 1970 in Italy by Silvio Marsan and his son, Stephan Marsan. The name is based off character's names in a children's book. Brandy Melville's first retail store was opened in 2009, bordering UCLA in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. By 2015, the brand had grown to 95 stores worldwide. In a similar way to Primark, the stores place little emphasis on advertising, relying instead on social media and word-of-mouth. The clothing line is extended to some pop-up stores in Nordstrom and Pac Sun. Though the company originated in Europe, Brandy adjusts their prices, clothing styles, and accessory items to American customers by taking \"store style\" photos of the clothing worn by the customers shopping in-store. To keep a European aesthetic within American stores, Brandy Melville marks the prices of clothing items with a fake \"euro\". One \"euro\" equals one American dollar. The company's products are sold in physical stores in places such as Europe, the United States, Asia, Canada, the United Kingdom and on their website. Brandy Melville has been described as trend-setting, relevant, and cool. Brandy's one-size-fits-all aspect has brought criticism and controversy upon the company, with some customers unable to fit into the brands clothing items, considering their size to be too big or small. Most of Brandy's apparel only offers clothing in one size except for some styles of jeans. Brandy's product research team consists of teenage employees starting at age 15 in an attempt to keep the company's styles contemporary. The return policy states that clothing may be exchanged or returned for store credit within 14 days of purchase and all accessories and intimates are final sale. \n",

Aco became La Salle's lieutenant because of his knowledge of Native American languages and his abilities as an explorer. When the party reached the Illinois River; Aco, Hennepin and another man were sent to explore the upper Mississippi. During their exploration, they became the first Europeans to see Carver's Cave and Saint Anthony Falls. They were later captured by Sioux Indians and held until the influence of Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut won their release. He was brought to the mouth of the Wisconsin River and went on to explore the Wisconsin River, the Fox River down to Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Mackinac Island, Michigan, and finally, in 1681, to Montreal. After his exploring days were over, Aco settled in Illinois and became a trader. He married Aramepinchieue, the daughter of a Kaskaskia chief in 1693, and had two children with her. \n",

      "The term mixed-blood in the United States is most often employed for individuals of mixed European and Native American ancestry. Some of the most prominent in the 19th century were mixed-blood or mixed-race descendants of fur traders and Native American women along the northern frontier. The fur traders tended to be men of social standing, and they often married or had relationships with daughters of Native American chiefs, consolidating social standing on both sides. They formed the upper tier of what was for years in the 18th and 19th centuries a two-tier society at settlements at trading posts, with other Europeans, American Indians and mixed-blood or Métis workers below them. Mixed-blood is also used occasionally in Canadian accounts to refer to the nineteenth century Anglo-Métis population rather than Métis, which referred to people of First Nations and French descent. Similarly in the Southeast, the Cherokee and other tribes started having inter-generational marriage and sexual relationships with the Europeans in the early 1700s. Many Cherokee bands and families were quick to see the economic benefits of having trade, land and business dealings with Europeans, strengthened through marriages. Prominent Cherokee and Creek leaders of the 19th century were of mixed-descent but, born to Indian mothers in matrilineal kinship societies, they identified fully and were accepted as Indian and grew up in those cultures. Renowned persons of mixed-blood ancestry in United States' history are many. One such example is Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, who guided the Mormon Battalion from New Mexico to the city of San Diego in California in 1846, and then accepted an appointment there as alcalde of Mission San Luis Rey. Both his parents worked with the Lewis and Clark Expedition, his mother Sacagawea as the invaluable Shoshone guide, and his French-Canadian father Toussaint Charbonneau as an interpreter of Shoshone and Hidatsa, cook and laborer. J.B. Charbonneau is depicted on the United States dollar coin along with his mother Sacagawea. Another example is Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 2008, in recognition of her literary contributions. She is recognized as the first Native American literary writer and poet, and the first Native American poet to write in an indigenous language. Jane Johnston was the daughter of a wealthy Scots-Irish fur trader and his Ojibwe wife, who was daughter of an Ojibwe chief. Johnston Schoolcraft was born in 1800 and lived most of her life in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, where she grew up in both cultures and learned French, English and Ojibwe. She wrote in English and Ojibwe. She married Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, who became a renowned ethnographer, in part due to her and her family's introduction to Native American culture. A major collection of her writings was published in 2007. Louise Erdrich is one of the best known contemporary Native American authors, whose fiction deals with the Ojibwe-American heritage of her Minnesota and reservation upbringing. She is of Ojibwe, German-American, and French ancestry. Among her many awards have been a Guggenheim Fellowship and National Book Critics Circle Award (1984), the latter for her early novel Love Medicine. In numerous novels over the last 20 years, she has created a richly imagined fictional universe of Native American and European American small town and reservation life. Mestizo is the contemporary term of choice for Hispanic individuals (whether US-born or immigrant) of a similar mixed ancestry (Indigenous and European), but based on different groups. Many Hispanic-Americans who have identified as \"white\" are of Spanish descent, having had ancestors in the southwestern United States for several generations prior to annexation of that region into the United States. However, identification on the US Census has historically been limited by its terminology, and the option to only select one \"race\" in the past. Others have classified themselves as mestizo, particularly those who also identify as Chicano. Hispanics of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent are most numerous on the East Coast, especially in Florida, New York and New England. The most recent Hispanic immigrants, who arrived during mid-century until today, have mainly identified as mestizo or Amerindian. They have come from Mexico, Central and South America. Of the over 35 million Hispanics counted in the Federal 2000 Census, the overwhelming majority of the 42.2% who identified as \"some other race\" are believed to be mestizos—a term not included on the US Census but widely used in Latin America. Of the 47.9% of Hispanics who identified as \"White Hispanic\", many acknowledge possessing Amerindian ancestry, as do many European Americans who identify as \"White\". Hispanics identifying as multiracial amounted to 6.3% (2.2 million) of all Hispanics; they likely included many mestizos as well as individuals of mixed Amerindian and African ancestry. \n",

In October 1930, Hope was adopted as the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for Stalybridge and Hyde, and contested it at the 1931 general election. The seat had been traditionally Conservative, but had been taken by Edmund Walter Hanbury Wood, a Labour candidate, at the previous general election.

At 26, he was one of the youngest members of parliament elected that year; the Baby of the House, Roland Robinson, was only two years younger. He did not make his maiden speech until 1934, when he objected to proposals to move Cheadle and Gatley into Greater Manchester.

In April 2012, Rajlich participated in an April Fools' Day prank on ChessBase - claiming by using Rybka he had proven to a \"99.99999999% certainty\" that the accepted King's Gambit is a draw for White, but only after 3. Be2. Rajlich later admitted on ChessBase, that, \"we're still probably a good 25 or so orders of magnitude away from being able to solve something like the King's Gambit. If processing power doubles every 18 months for the next century, we'll have the resources to do this around the year 2120, plus or minus a few decades\".

Despite his poor storytelling skills, he was credited by showing \"tremendous inventiveness in his adventures, with intergalactic wars and invasions on an immense scale.\" Mike Ashley states that \"Schlossel's writing was basic but his imagination and vision made him one of the more significant contributors to the early SF Magazines\". Schlossel was born in New York in 1902. He was raised in Toronto and became a tailor, his father's line of work. His first story was published in Weird Tales in 1925, where his next two stories appeared. Beginning in 1926, his remaining work was sold to Amazing Stories. After the Great Depression set in, he left his trade, took employment in metal plating, and stopped writing. He died in 1977. His work usually carried the byline \"J. Schlossel\". None of his stories have appeared in book form, although two were reprinted in later sf magazines. \n",

It is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Long Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The refuge is composed of mature oak-hickory forest, a rocky beach, a brackish pond, and several vernal ponds. The land and waters support a variety of songbirds (particularly warblers during spring migration), mammals, shorebirds, fish, reptiles and amphibians. During the colder months, diving ducks are common offshore, while harbor seals occasionally use the beach and nearby rocks as resting sites. New York State and federally protected piping plover, least tern, and common tern depend on the refuge's rocky shore for foraging and rearing young. The spring bloom at Target Rock is a reminder of its days as a garden estate, with flowering rhododendrons and mountain laurel. \n",

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest naval architects in American history. On June 2, 1900, during the testimony of Mr. Gardiner C. Sims, Superintending Engineer, Army Transport Service, New York City, for the House Inquiry into the Transport Service between San Francisco and the Philippine Islands, the question was asked ...  Q. Who is Mr. Kirby, and why should you have had any talk with him about the ship?—A. He is a successful marine engineer of national reputation. He prepared plans and specifications for the refitting of the Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Logan, and Thomas, and his precedents I am following as carefully as possible. He is at present engaged in the practice of his profession on the lakes, and he is consulting engineer, you might call it, of the transport branch of the Quartermaster's Department.  As the questioning continued, it was asked ...  Q. Does Mr. Kirby still continue to act as consulting engineer in regard to refitting of the transports?—A. Yes, sir; he did on the plans for refitting the Kilpatrick and Buford, but since I have been here he has never been connected directly with the department. Q. How is that arrived at?—A. Through the office of the Quartermaster-General. Colonel Bird (Charles F. Bird, Quartermaster in Charge of Ocean Transportation, San Francisco, California) stated he desired to have Mr. Kirby go over the plans where repairs are very large.  And two days later, during his testimony, Col. F. B. Jones, General Superintendent, Army Transport Service, New York City, said ...  To refer again to the refitting of transports. The Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, and Relief were refitted before my connection with the service. The Thomas and Logan were started soon afterwards, and I think the suggestion came from the Quartermaster-General's Office that we would employ Mr. Kirby, an expert marine architect, a man who is consulted by many shipowners and ship associations as an authority on ship construction. I was, of course, more than glad to have him assigned to that work and knew that the proper thing had been done in order that the best results might be obtained.  Kirby mostly specialized in paddle-wheel and steamship design. Perhaps his most famous vessel, Tashmoo, was a paddle-wheeler launched on New Year's Eve, 1899. She was constructed by the Detroit Shipbuilding Company in Wyandotte, Mich., for the White Star Steamship Co. of Detroit. The 306-foot vessel made her maiden voyage on June 9, 1900. She would become one of the best known - and most beloved - excursion steamers on the Great Lakes. Kirby also is well-renowned for his design of the \"Bob-Lo boats\" - the Columbia and the Ste. Claire. Bob-Lo Island was a major amusement park destination for residents of southeast Michigan (and southern Ontario, Canada) throughout most of the twentieth century. He is also considered the father of modern ice-breaking technology. He designed the D&C Navigation Co.’s armada of stately night boats, including the City of Detroit III. \n",

During the election, voters in Guelph claimed to have received robocalls, purporting to be from Elections Canada, which falsely informed them that the location of their polling stations had changed. Sona, perhaps along with others, had arranged for the calls in an attempt to suppress voters intending to vote for other political parties. After the allegations first arose in the media, Sona appeared on CBC's Power & Politics with Evan Solomon where he denied any involvement in the scandal. During the interview, Sona claimed he had no information about who was responsible but was \"not going to take the fall for something [he] didn't do\". Following investigations by Elections Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Sona was charged with willfully preventing or endeavouring to prevent an elector from voting in an election, an offence under the Canada Elections Act. On August 14, 2014, Sona was found guilty; however, Justice Hearn noted that Sona had likely not acted alone. The Court found that Sona displayed a \"callous and blatant disregard for the right of people to vote\" as part of an \"ill-conceived and disturbing plan\". No one else has been charged or convicted in relation to this matter. Sona was the first and, to date, only person ever convicted of endeavouring to prevent an elector from voting.

The majority of Liverpool's matches were close affairs, they did not score more than two goals in any of their matches and this was also their biggest margin of victory. Leeds' matches ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories. They won their third round tie against Stockport County 3–0, while they beat Manchester United 1–0 in a semi-final replay following a 0–0 draw in the initial match. Watched by a crowd of 100, 000, the first 90 minutes of the match were goalless as both sides struggled to create goalscoring chances. Liverpool defender Gerry Byrne broke his collarbone early in the match but carried on as there were no substitutes. He was involved in the opening goal in extra time. Byrne found striker Roger Hunt in the 93rd minute, with a cross from the right-hand side of the pitch, which Hunt headed into the Leeds goal to give Liverpool the lead. Leeds equalised seven minutes later when Billy Bremner scored. However, Liverpool regained the lead in the 117th minute when striker Ian St. John headed in a pass from Ian Callaghan. Liverpool won the match 2–1 to win the FA Cup for the first time. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly was delighted with his team's victory and hailed it as his greatest moment in management. His Leeds counterpart, Don Revie, conceded Liverpool had been the better team, but was determined to make amends the following season. The national media was critical of the final, labelling it 'boring'. \n",

It was recorded in a rented home studio in Hollywood by lead vocalist Marilyn Manson and guitarist and bassist Tim Sköld, and was produced by Manson and Sköld. It was the band's first album not to be recorded as a five-piece, as John 5 departed from the group in 2004. Instead of replacing 5, Tim Sköld remained with bass and played guitar, and the band continued as a four-piece. Manson has stated that he sang most of the album lying down on the studio floor with his hands cupping the studio microphone, resulting in a very distinctive vocal sound. Of Sköld's compositions, a further two are said to have been turned into fully-fledged songs with lyrics, music and vocals completed but were not put onto album for fear of making it overwrought. Upon its release, Eat Me, Drink Me was met with positive reviews from critics, and debuted at number eight on the US Billboard 200. The album was the last to feature band member Tim Sköld, and spawned two singles (\"Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)\" and \"Putting Holes in Happiness\").

The son of two prominent communist activists Arnold Kettle (best remembered as a literary critic, 1916–86) and Margot Kettle (née Gale, 1916–1995), Martin Kettle was educated at Leeds Modern School and Balliol College, Oxford University. Kettle worked for the National Council for Civil Liberties (now known as Liberty) as a research officer from 1973. He then began his career in journalism as home affairs correspondent for New Society (1977–1981) and moved to The Sunday Times in 1981, working as a political correspondent for three years. He has been with The Guardian since 1984 and also wrote regularly for Marxism Today in its later years. He writes a column on classical music in Prospect magazine. Kettle is best known as a columnist for The Guardian, where he is assistant editor, having worked as the newspaper's Washington D.C. bureau chief 1997–2001. He was formerly a leader writer (1993–1997) and chief leader writer 2001 onwards. Martin Kettle has often defended New Labour and Tony Blair (a personal friend) – though not over the Iraq War. However, soon after the 2010 general election, Kettle wrote that David Cameron's Conservative-led Coalition had had a positive effect on the country. He has been dismissed by John Pilger as Blair's \"most devoted promoter\". Kettle has a low opinion of Boris Johnson, Kettle wrote, \"The immediate effect of the judgment [when the Supreme Court declared the prorogation of Parliament invalid] is devastating for Johnson. It is expressed so cogently and unambiguously that it will be difficult for him to wriggle out of it – even though he is certainly foolish enough to try. Parliament will surely be recalled on Tuesday – since, as the judgment said, it has not been prorogued in the first place. Johnson’s efforts, to the extent that they exist at all, to negotiate a new or tweaked deal with the EU will be held up to the light. And, since Johnson spectacularly lacks a majority in the House of Commons, it is likely that the cross-party efforts to shape Brexit will be redoubled.\" \n",

The only Speaker to serve for five complete consecutive Congresses, he is the third longest-serving Speaker in American history after Sam Rayburn and Henry Clay in terms of total tenure, and longest-serving in terms of continuous tenure (Rayburn and Clay having served multiple terms in the Speakership). Born in North Cambridge, Massachusetts, O'Neill began campaigning at a young age, volunteering for Al Smith's campaign in the 1928 presidential election. After graduating from Boston College, O'Neill won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he became a strong advocate of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies. He became Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1949 and won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1952 to the seat vacated by John F. Kennedy. In the House, O'Neill became a protege of fellow Massachusetts Representative John William McCormack. O'Neill broke with President Lyndon B. Johnson on the Vietnam War in 1967, and called for Richard Nixon's resignation in light of the Watergate scandal. He quickly moved up the leadership ranks in the 1970s, becoming House Majority Whip in 1971, House Majority Leader in 1973, and Speaker of the House in 1977. With the election of President Jimmy Carter, O'Neill hoped to establish a universal health care system and a guaranteed jobs program. However, relations between Carter and Congress collapsed and Democrats lost control of the presidency in the 1980 presidential election. O'Neill became a leading opponent of Republican President Ronald Reagan's conservative domestic policies. O'Neill and Reagan found more common ground in foreign policy, fostering the Anglo-Irish Agreement and implementing the Reagan Doctrine in the Soviet–Afghan War. O'Neill retired from Congress in 1987, but remained active in public life. He published a best-selling autobiography and appeared in several commercials and other media.

The song is in a somewhat more conventional rock style than their punk-oriented debut, \"That's Too Bad\", and features sound effects simulating air raid sirens, dive bombers, and machine gun fire. Like its predecessor, the single earned indifferent reviews and failed to chart. It is one of the few recordings in his career which Numan did not produce himself. Though their musical styles differ, the song's subject matter is generally seen as a thinly disguised rewrite of David Bowie's \"Five Years\", the opening track of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972). Both songs feature detached observations of urban panic caused by impending catastrophe. \"Bombers\" (which has nothing to do with another Bowie track of the same name) is sung from the perspective of both a witness on the ground (\"Look up, I hear the scream of sirens on the wall\") and the bomber pilot (\"And me I know just where you are, you see I'm a bomber man\"). In his review for Record Mirror in October 1978, Robin Smith stated that \"..the market for this sort of heavyweight monotony has died.\" The B-sides were \"Blue Eyes\", which harked back to the fast-paced punk style of \"That's Too Bad\", and \"O.D. Receiver\", a slower piece whose lyrics reflected a Burroughsian world of drug addiction.

Burlison was born in Brownsville, Tennessee, where he was exposed to music at an early age. After a stint in the United States Military, Burlison teamed up with Johnny and Dorsey Burnette to form The Rock and Roll Trio. The band released several singles, but failed to attain chart success. Paul is sometimes credited with being the first guitarist to intentionally record with a distorted electric guitar on the 1956 recordings, \"Lonesome Train on a Lonesome Track\" and \"Honey Hush.\" The Trio disbanded in the fall of 1957 and Burlison moved back to Tennessee to start a family. There he started his own electrical subcontracting business which he ran faithfully for twenty years, taking a break when the Trio reunited in the early 1980s. He released his only solo album in 1997, which received positive reviews. Burlison remained active in the music scene until his death in 2003. Burlison and his family lived in Brownsville until 1937. During the floods of that year, miserable economic conditions prompted the Burlison family to move to Memphis, Tennessee. In 1938, his brother-in-law, Earl Brooks began to teach him to play the guitar. As well as learning Brooks' Country influenced techniques, he also drew inspiration from watching Jesse Lee and Juanita Denson perform. Later, he would frequent the Blues joints along Beale Street. While he was still in high school, he would travel to the outskirts of West Memphis, Arkansas, to watch Chester Burnett (\"Howlin' Wolf\") play. Burlison also developed an interest in boxing and began training at the Dave Wells Community Center under the instruction of trainer, Jim Denson. He was to win the local welterweight championship, and was runner-up in the All-Navy Tournament 1947-48. Whilst competing in the 1949 Golden Gloves tournament, Denson introduced him to another young boxer, Dorsey Burnette. Dorsey Burnette would become a Golden Gloves welterweight champion.

      "Overseas Consultants Inc. was formed by the merger of eleven top U.S. engineering and management firms in the 1940s. In one of its first major undertakings, the company conducted a six-month industrial reparations survey of post-World War II Japan in 1947. It ultimately prepared a report for General Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur's general view, however, was that Japan had already paid a heavy price, in that the war had totally shattered the Japanese economy, and Japan had lost all of the territories it had occupied in Manchuria, Korea, North China and the outer islands. (740.00119 Control (Japan)/3-2548, Report by the Director of the Policy Planning Staff (Kennan), March 25, 1948). The company also did work in underdeveloped countries. In the late 1940s, many poor countries desired to raise their standard of living by increasing output of food, natural resources and manufactured goods. Iran, for example, made a noteworthy start toward this end by engaging Overseas Consultants Inc. to advise on a proposed US$650, 000, 000 development program. (TIME Magazine, Oct. 24, 1949). The company conducted a detailed study that ultimately resulted in a multi-volume report. Today, the report provides invaluable historical insight into the economic development of Iran as of the late 1940s. Unfortunately, implementation of the plan fizzled out because the impoverished Iranian government lacked sufficient funds. Foreign aid donors - during, in part, the brief rule of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadeq - did not provide money for implementation. (TIME Magazine, Jun. 4, 1951). The foreign aid donors were not forthcoming because Mossadeq and the Iranian government wished to see those funds or loans benefit Iran's oil industry directly, not benefit the Iranian-Anglo Oil company exclusively, which was owned principally by the British government. OCI was represented by the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, two of whose employees and partners were John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles who in 1950 were not yet fully part of the U.S. government. When the OCI contract was thwarted by Mossadeq and the Iranian Parliament, John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles declared personal war on Mossadeq. Once the two Dulles brothers officially entered United States government in 1953 as the Secretary of State and the Director of the CIA they arranged, with the help of Christopher Montague Woodhouse, the former chief of British intelligence in Iran, and head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, Sir John Sinclair, often referred to as \"C\", to overthrow Mohammed Mossadeq's government. The overthrow was overseen by Frank Wisner, a friend of Allen Dulles in Washington and a subordinate at the CIA. The onsite partner in the overthrow and CIA employee was Kermit Roosevelt. Mohammed Mossadeq detested Communism and considered the new President, General Eisenhower, a friend. Mossadeq's main crime was to thwart the profits of the Dulles brothers personally, their firm Sullivan & Cromwell, their clients OCI, the J. Schroder Banking Corporation, and Chase Manhattan Bank. The two banking clients appear to be minor players, the identity of the eleven engineering and consulting firms remains obscure and their pervasive influence in the post war rebuilding process something that needs to be further researched. The most disturbing thing about this incident involving Iran, the CIA, and the Dulles brothers, this is the introduction into world history of Frank Wisner the man in charge of the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by the CIA in April 1961. Secondly the introduction by the Dulles brothers, Frank Wisner, and the CIA into history's stream of Mohammad Reza Shah later to be catalyst for the \"Iranian Hostage Crisis\" and the overthrow of the Shah by the Ayotallah Khomeini. Overseas Consultants also worked in such remote places as the southern highlands of Central Africa, studying vegetation and soils with respect to possible railroad construction. \n",

As its name suggests, it was primarily for teams in the Glasgow area, but did include teams from towns outside the city; conversely, other leagues existed concurrently (such as the Scottish Junior Football League) and some teams based in Glasgow played in those. The league was seen as one of the strongest in Scotland, with its clubs winning or reaching the final of the national knockout competition, the Scottish Junior Cup, several times. Membership varied, with mergers involving other leagues occurring on various occasions and individual teams being enticed to join the GJL from those leagues. Having continued through World War I, the GJL was dissolved in 1927 when the intermediate dispute occurred; however its members (and other clubs) formed the Scottish Intermediate Football League which was contested for four years. In 1931, the Central Junior League was formed, with notes from its 1932 AGM stating that it was the 32nd such meeting, suggesting that it was considered a continuation of the pre-1927 GJL. This setup continued until 1968 when the Central League merged with the long-running Lanarkshire Junior League as the Central Region, and eventually 2002 the Ayrshire Junior League (many of whose clubs had also been involved in the intermediate dispute of the 1920s, although they played in a separate division) joined to create the extant Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region.

IBP was the United States' biggest beef packer and its number two pork processor. To reflect the company's multiple operations, the company changed its name to Iowa Beef Processors, Inc. in 1970. After the company expanded operations to pork and other areas, Iowa Beef Processors, Inc., became IBP, Inc. Occidental Petroleum owned IBP from 1981 to 1987, and was the majority owner from 1987 to 1991. The original IBP features prominently in Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation as the company that closed down the Chicago meatpacking district as a result of its industrial practices. Founded as Iowa Beef Packers, Inc. on March 17, 1960 by Currier J. Holman and A.D. Anderson, it opened its first slaughterhouse in Denison, Iowa, and eliminated the need for skilled workers. In 1967, IBP introduced boxed beef and pork, which were vacuum packed and in smaller portions. It was a new option then, when the traditional method of shipping product was in whole carcass form. The boxed meat also saved energy and transportation costs by eliminating the shipment of fat, bones and trimmings. When workers in the IBP plant in Dakota City went on strike in 1969, Holman and three top executives held secret meetings with Moe Steinman, a 'labour consultant' with close ties to La Cosa Nostra, in New York, who helped to end the New York butchers' boycott (in support of the meatpackers' strike). After a lengthy investigation of mob involvement in the New York City meat business, Currier J. Holman and IBP were tried and convicted in 1974 for bribing union leaders and meat wholesalers. IBP was acquired by Tyson Foods in 2001 for US$3.2 billion in cash and stock. Tyson continues to use the IBP name as a brand for its commodity beef and pork products. \n",

      "Leetown is an unincorporated community in Jefferson County in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It lies along West Virginia Secondary Route 1 at its junction with Leetown Pike. An early historical distinction of the town is the interesting confluence of the estates of three British born, British colonial military officers who served under General Braddock and were all involved in the disastrous British operations against French and Indian forces at Fort Duquesne (modern Pittsburgh) and who later became American revolutionary officers under George Washington. The town is named for the eccentric General Charles Lee, a British officer. He was born in Cheshire in 1732 and purchased an estate in Virginia in 1776. He called the estate \"Prato Rio\" and the main house rests today just south of town. Major General Adam Stephen established a hunting lodge “The Bower” in 1750 one mile west of Leetown along Opequon Creek. Their mutual Revolutionary War colleague General Horatio Gates, the victor of the Battle of Saratoga, lived four miles north of town in the estate \"Traveler’s Rest\". St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church is an attractive feature of Leetown. It was consecrated in 1846 as part of the recovery of the Episcopal Church in (then) Virginia after its low ebb in the years after the Revolution. The church was badly damaged during the Civil War. The town is featured in the documentation of the general ebb and flow of forces during the Civil War. On July 3, 1864 a running battle took place through the town in which troops under Lieutenant General Jubal Early, after initial setback, prevailed over Federal forces. The victory cleared the way for Early’s entry into Maryland as part of the third and last Confederate invasion of the North, culminating in a Pyrrhic victory at Monocacy Junction near Frederick, Maryland on July 8. After the conflict, the artist David English Henderson resided in Leetown, rendering on canvas his memories as a soldier in the Army of Northern Virginia. Today the town hosts the US Department of Interior’s Leetown Science Center. Established in 1931 as the first Federal Fishery research facility, the Center’s current mission is to provide expertise from a broad diversity of scientific disciplines to conduct integrated research programs addressing the high priority needs of natural resource managers and public policy makers. \n",

As of 31 December 2018, it had a population of 1, 048 and an area of 85.7 km². Sellano borders the following municipalities: Campello sul Clitunno, Cerreto di Spoleto, Foligno, Trevi, Visso. Sellano is built on the hill that overlooks the course of the Vigi river, archaeological findings suggest that the site was already inhabited in pre-Roman times and certainly the first development as a feud dates back to the Longobard era. In the 12th century Sellano became a free municipality and, due to its strategic position, its control was long disputed between the municipality of Spoleto, the Collicola, lords of Montesanto, and the imperial curia. From 1522, the year of an unsuccessful revolt against Spoleto, Sellano remained part of the papal state until the unification of Italy in 1861. Originally the castle was surrounded by two orders of walls, of which portions are still visible today, and had four access gates, of which only the Porta dell'Annunziata remains, in the oldest, north side of the town; the arched gate (originally frescoed) is now part of a house, originally a convent and then hospital, with adjacent excavations that reveal the remains of the original XIII century building; inside is a 14th century fresco attributed to the master of Cesi. Of the adjacent church of the Annunziata only scattered ruins remain, while of the other three doors located at the cardinal points there is no trace. The medieval structure of the village has remained intact and develops on the crest of the hill around three small squares, on the central one there is the church of Santa Maria Assunta which dates back to the 12th century but was remodeled several times, especially in the 16th century and then after the 1703 earthquake. Inside, one can admire canvases from the 16th and 17th centuries and a carved walnut pulpit. It holds the remains of the blessed Giolo, a hermit who lived between 1250 and 1315, an anchorite, co-patron of Sellano. Next to the church and connected to it by an arch that forms the base of the bell tower, there is a noble palace that reveals the various stages of reconstruction from the Middle Ages to the 18th century. Inside, 17th century frescoes survive. The town hall with a 16th century façade faces the upper square, with parts of the 15th and 16th century frescoes, and the alleys lined by several prestigious buildings, mostly from the 18th century and built on the original medieval plan. At the entrance of the village is the church of San Francesco, built in 1538 with an octagonal plan and the remains of the original frescoes. The municipality of Sellano includes many smaller villages, most of which present elements of considerable historical and architectural interest. The nature of the surrounding valleys and mountains is pristine and varied, rich in diverse flora and fauna, ideal for eco-tourism and trekking. \n",

      "The Victoria Cross (VC) is a military decoration that may be bestowed upon members of the British or Commonwealth armed forces for acts of valour or gallantry performed in the face of the enemy. Within the British honours system and those of many Commonwealth nations it is the highest award a soldier can receive for actions in combat. It was established in 1856 and since then has been awarded 1, 356 times, including three service personnel who were awarded the VC twice. The VC was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War. The traditional explanation of the source of the gunmetal from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian cannon captured at the siege of Sevastopol. Recent research has thrown doubt on this story, suggesting a variety of origins. The original Royal Warrant did not contain a specific clause regarding posthumous awards, although official policy was to not award the VC posthumously. Between 1897 and 1901, several notices were issued in the London Gazette regarding soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, six of the soldiers mentioned were granted the VC, but not \"officially\" awarded the medal. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six officers and men. The Victoria Cross warrant was not officially amended to explicitly allow posthumous awards until 1920 but one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous. Due to its rarity, the VC is highly prized and the medal has fetched over £400, 000 at auction. A number of public and private collections are devoted to the Victoria Cross. The private collection of Lord Ashcroft, amassed since 1986, contains over one-tenth of all VCs awarded. Following a 2008 donation to the Imperial War Museum, the Ashcroft collection went on public display alongside the museum's Victoria and George Cross collection in November 2010. Since 1990, three Commonwealth countries that retain the Queen as head of state have instituted their own versions of the VC. As a result, the original Victoria Cross is sometimes referred to as the \"Commonwealth Victoria Cross\" or the \"Imperial Victoria Cross\", to distinguish it from the newer awards. The first awards to cavalrymen were the nine awarded during the Crimean War, the first seven in the Charge of the Light Brigade 25 October 1854. The largest number for any one campaign was the twenty-nine awarded during the Indian Mutiny (also known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857), twelve of those to one regiment, the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers. All together ninety-two awards have been made to cavalrymen, the last on 23 September 1918 in the final days of the First World War. \n",

      "George Edwards Brown (1780–1848) was an English-born Chilean businessman. George Edwards was the son of a carpenter John Edwards and his wife Elizabeth Brown, as stated in his baptism certificate in the parish of Saint Leonard's of London. George “Jorge” Edwards Brown was an English sailor who later lived and served in Chile. He was the founder and patriarch of the Edwards family in Chile. He sailed from a young age in British ships engaged in trade and privateering or looting. He travelled across Spanish South America visiting Chile for the first time in 1797. It was not until 1804 that his name could be inscribed in the history of Chile. The previous year he had enlisted as a surgeon in the British raider “Blackhouse” or “Bacar” who were dedicated to looting and plundering ships and ports in the Spanish colonies in South America. During this trip, Bacar anchored in the bay of Coquimbo and then taken by assault the city which was unguarded. During the sack of the city Jorge Edwards entered the house of Diego de Ossandón to steal, but he found his daughter, Isabel de Ossandón, who he fell in love with immediately. He decided to desert the ship and asking for shelter in the house of Diego Ossandón. Family tradition says that when Edwards did not return to the British ship, they spent three days looking for him through all the houses in the city. Edwards hid for three days, hiding in a barrel of wine from his former shipmates. On the third day Spanish reinforcements arrived, forcing the British to retreat from the city, to continue their raids to the north. Once the Spanish authorities were aware of the presence of Edwards in La Serena, he was arrested and sent to Callao, where he was detained. Once released he returned to La Serena in 1805 he was baptized into the Catholic faith. The baptism certificate recognizes that parents are Juan Eduardos (John Edwards) and Isabel Pardo (Elizabeth Brown), Spanish forms of their Welsh and English names respectively. After that he went to work as a doctor and surgeon for some years, but quickly became the enabler or lender of small miners in the area of Coquimbo, which allowed him to build a small fortune after 10 years. His distinctly anti-Spanish feelings made him a supporter of the patriot cause during the Chilean Wars of Independence, making donations to build the fleet for the liberation of Peru, commanded by a fellow Brit, Lord Thomas Cochrane. The Supreme Director of Chile, Bernardo O'Higgins granted Edwards Chilean citizenship papers in 1818 as a reward for his services to the Independence cause. He was appointed Deputy for Huasco in 1822. He was President of the Provincial Assembly of Coquimbo in 1825, Deputy for Andacollo in 1826 and Deputy of Vallenar in 1834. Jorge Edwards married his first wife Isabel Ossandón Iribarren in 1807, with which he had 8 children, including Agustín Edwards Ossandón. Widowed in 1834, he married his second wife Ventura Argandoña Subercaseaux, with whom he had children. \n",

      "Alexander Douglas Weston (December 13, 1926 in Manhattan, New York – February 14, 1999 in Los Angeles, California) was an American nightclub owner, known as the owner of The Troubadour nightclub in Los Angeles, California, United States, which in the 1960s and 1970s was particularly responsible for promoting many successful singer-songwriters in the early stages of their careers. Weston founded the club as a coffee house on La Cienega Boulevard in 1957. It moved to its current location at 9081 Santa Monica Boulevard, West Hollywood in 1961, and has remained open continuously ever since. The Troubadour played an important role in the careers of Elton John, Linda Ronstadt, the Eagles, The Byrds, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Carole King, Bonnie Raitt, J.D. Souther, Jackson Browne, Van Morrison, Buffalo Springfield, Guns N’ Roses and other prominent and successful performers, whose early performances at the club helped establish their future fame. Los Angeles Times music critic Robert Hilburn said that Weston was \"arguably the godfather of the Southern California singer-songwriter movement in the late '60s and early '70s\". A charismatic impresario, 6'6\" tall with long hair, Weston became known for the agreements he made with new artists, which stipulated that, after they became famous, they would return to the club to perform. According to Hilburn: In later years, Weston was no longer involved in running the club, but retained ownership. He died from pneumonia in a Los Angeles hospital on February 14, 1999, aged 72. A memorial was held at the Troubadour with performances and dedications from musicians as a tribute to him for his role in the success in so many musicians' careers.

      "George Parrish Tebbetts (1828 – January 9, 1909) was an American politician from California. Tebbetts was born in Concord, New Hampshire and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1848, where he studied medicine. With the California gold rush he sailed to San Francisco. While crossing the Isthmus of Panama, he cared for people suffering from yellow fever. He prospected with a Chinese boy on the American River near Sacramento and they extracted $70, 000 in gold. The San Diego History Center describes what followed: They returned to San Francisco. \"There the boy expressed a wish to return to China, and Tebbetts settled with him for $3, 000. The boy returned to China, and as the years rolled by, nothing was heard from him. Forty-five years later he walked into Tebbett's office in Santa Barbara and introduced himself. The surprise meeting after so many years was an enjoyable occasion, with much reminiscing by the two lucky gold seekers.\" Tebbetts arrived in San Diego around 1850 and was co-proprietor of the Exchange Hotel. He was elected Councilman for 1851–1852. In 1852 he became the third mayor of San Diego under U.S. rule. While mayor, a series of murders, horse thievery, and lawlessness caused locals to organize The Vigilantes to keep the peace. When Tebbetts' horse was stolen, the thieves were caught, paraded around town with nooses around their necks, and lynched. Federal officials investigated, but gave up when Tebbetts told them the entire town was involved. In 1852 the city was bankrupt. The city charter was abolished and city administration was performed by a Board of Trustees with no mayor, operated by the state. Tebbetts later was member of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors during 1854-1864. During an Indian war at Warner Springs in the early 1850s, Tebbetts served as ensign with Fitzgerald's Volunteers. The uprising was caused by an 1844 Mexican land grant that included Cupa, the village of the Cupeňo people, and surrounding homelands. During the war Tebbetts participated in a \"Dual\" with Joshua Bean as a practical joke. Tebbets ran the Exchange Hotel, with a partner Philip Hooff, from 1850 or 1851. The hotel was owned by his father-in-law Juan Rodríguez and sold in 1858. George Derby immortalized them in his satirical book Phoenixiana referring to Tebbetts and Hoof as \"Two bitts\" (because of his small size) and \"Cloven Hooff\". Tebbetts bought the San Luis Rey Ranch in the late 1850s. In the late 1860s he moved to Santa Barbara where he bought the San Roque Ranch, was appointed Postmaster, and started the Santa Barbara Press, Daily Independent, and Daily News. Tebbetts married twice, with four children (Horace, Stella, John, and Maria Virginia De Los Reyes) from his first marriage with Delorez Rodríguez (Maria Delos Reyes Osuna Y Rodriguez), daughter of Juan Rodríguez, and three children from his second marriage to Mary Jones. Maria Tebbetts (Maria Virginia De Los Reyes Tebbetts) married Brigadier-General Frank Clarke Prescott N.G.C. Later, he moved in with his son Nathan in San Francisco where he died 1909. \n",

Bilbao is the tenth largest city in Spain, with a population of 345, 141 as of 2015. The Bilbao metropolitan area has 1, 037, 847 inhabitants, making it one of the most populous metropolitan areas in northern Spain; with a population of 875, 552 the comarca of Greater Bilbao is the fifth-largest urban area in Spain. Bilbao is also the main urban area in what is defined as the Greater Basque region. Bilbao is situated in the north-central part of Spain, some south of the Bay of Biscay, where the economic social development is located, where the estuary of Bilbao is formed. Its main urban core is surrounded by two small mountain ranges with an average elevation of . Its climate is shaped by the Bay of Biscay low-pressure systems and mild air, moderating summer temperatures by Iberian standards, with low sunshine and high rainfall. The annual temperature range is low for its latitude. After its foundation in the early 14th century by Diego López V de Haro, head of the powerful Haro family, Bilbao was a commercial hub of the Basque Country that enjoyed significant importance in Green Spain. This was due to its port activity based on the export of iron extracted from the Biscayan quarries. Throughout the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Bilbao experienced heavy industrialisation, making it the centre of the second-most industrialised region of Spain, behind Barcelona. At the same time an extraordinary population explosion prompted the annexation of several adjacent municipalities. Nowadays, Bilbao is a vigorous service city that is experiencing an ongoing social, economic, and aesthetic revitalisation process, started by the iconic Bilbao Guggenheim Museum, and continued by infrastructure investments, such as the airport terminal, the rapid transit system, the tram line, the Azkuna Zentroa, and the currently under development Abandoibarra and Zorrozaurre renewal projects. Bilbao is also home to football club Athletic Club de Bilbao, a significant symbol for Basque nationalism due to its promotion of only Basque players and one of the most successful clubs in Spanish football history. On 19 May 2010, the city of Bilbao was recognised with the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, awarded by the city state of Singapore, in collaboration with the Swedish Nobel Academy. Considered the Nobel Prize for urbanism, it was handed out on 29 June 2010. On 7 January 2013, its mayor, Iñaki Azkuna, received the 2012 World Mayor Prize awarded every two years by the British foundation The City Mayors Foundation, in recognition of the urban transformation experienced by the Biscayan capital since the 1990s.

The seventh holder of the first creation was elevated to the peerage as Earl of Liverpool in 1796, a title which became extinct in 1851. The first Jenkinson baronetcy, of Walcot in the County of Oxford and of Hawkesbury in the County of Gloucester, was created on 18 May 1661 for Robert Jenkinson. He had earlier represented Oxfordshire in Parliament. His son, the second Baronet, and grandsons, the third and fourth Baronet, also represented this constituency in the House of Commons. The seventh Baronet (the son of Charles Jenkinson, younger son of the second Baronet) was a prominent politician and notably served as President of the Board of Trade and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In 1786 he was created Baron Hawkesbury, of Hawkesbury in the County of Gloucester, in the Peerage of Great Britain, and in 1796 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Liverpool, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. His eldest son, the second Earl, was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1812 to 1827. He was succeeded by his half-brother, the third Earl, who notably held office as Lord Steward of the Household from 1841 to 1846. On his death the barony and earldom became extinct. The titles were revived in 1893 and 1905 respectively for his grandson Cecil Foljambe (the son of his daughter Selina Charlotte; see the Earl of Liverpool).

      "John Baptist Banister (1654 – May 1692) was an English clergyman and one of the first university-trained naturalists in North America. His primary focus was botany but he also studied insects and molluscs. He was sent out as a missionary chaplain by the garden-loving Bishop Henry Compton, with whom he soon established a correspondence. Banister was first in Barbados in the West Indies and then by April 1679 in Virginia, where, while serving a rector of the parish of Charles City he became one of Bishop Compton's most energetic plant collectors, \"the first Virginia botanist of any note\". Banister matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he could see and study the American plants grown from seed in the Oxford Physic Garden under the care of Dr. Robert Morison. From Virginia, his first letter to Dr Morison at the Oxford Physic Garden was dated 1679: in it he listed the bounty of American oaks that would supplement Britain's impoverished flora: dwarf, black, white, red, Spanish, chestnut, live or willow, shrubby. The historian of American gardens Ann Leighton surmises that Banister's list of Virginian timber trees provided some of the material for John Evelyn's list of desirable plants of Virginia and New England, intended to be given to a captain sailing for New England. Once settled in Virginia, where he purchased a tract of on the Appomattox River in 1689/90, he established a close friendship with William Byrd of Westover, an influential Virginia planter with botanical connections in London. By 1692 Banister had become a substantial figure in Virginia, one of the founders of the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg that year; Bishop Compton was on the college's board of overseers. Banister contemplated writing a natural history of Virginia; perhaps it was as a preliminary gesture he sent some fine botanical drawings and herbarium specimens to the botanist James Petiver, a London apothecary and Fellow of the Royal Society. According to Jon Kukla Robert Beverley's History and Present State of Virginia (London, 1705) reproduced extensive passages on natural history and the Indians from manuscripts of Banister. Banister sent numerous occasional papers to the Royal Society that were published in its Philosophical Transactions, providing \"the first scientific account for Virginia in the field of descriptive botany, entomology, and malacology. His letter describing Mutinus elegans, a stinkhorn, is thought to be the first report of a fungus from North America. Among them were \"Observations on the natural productions of Jamaica\"; \"The Insects of Virginia\" (with James Petiver, 1700); \"Curiosities in Virginia\"; \"Observations on the Musca lupus\"; \"On Several Sorts of Snails\" ; and \"A Description of the Snakeroot, Pistolochia or Serpentaria Virginiania.\" He compiled a catalogue of American plants, the first flora of North America; it was published in the second volume of John Ray's Historia Plantarum (London, 1688-1704), a comprehensive catalog of plant taxonomy. He was accidentally shot dead by Jacob Colson while exploring the lower Roanoke River in company with some men of Byrd's entourage. John Lawson in his New Voyage to Carolina saluted Banister's memory in 1709, as \"the greatest Virtuosowe ever had on this Continent\". Notable plants he collected and sent to his bishop, Henry Compton, in England included balsam fir (Abies balsamea), box elder (Acer negundo), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), liquidambar (Liquidambar styraciflua), scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), and Sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana). Banister's library in Virginia was dispersed after his death and his lists and papers found their way to publication through other botanists, beginning with James Petiver, whose Museum Petiveranum gives 65 common names for Banister's plants sent to Bishop Compton, where Banister's Virginian trees were flourishing in the gardens of Fulham Palace. Banister was commemorated by Linnaeus who gave the name Banisteria to a tropical genus of Malpighiaceae. Banisteriopsis also references Banister's name; the two genera are very close relatives and are sometimes merged under the older name Banisteria. His grandson, Col. John Banister, was one of the prominent Virginians of the American Revolution. \n",

He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to Scottish parents, one of six children of John H. and Mary Littleson McKellar. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of British Columbia, graduating in 1930. He began graduate studies at the University of California, being awarded his M.S. in 1932 and a Ph.D. the following year. Applying to the United States National Research Council, he was awarded a post-doctoral study program for two years at MIT. In 1935 he joined the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, where he performed research into astrophysics. He was married to Mary Crouch (b. June 3, 1911, d. Nov. 30, 2000) in 1938, and the couple bore two children, Andrew Robert William (Bob) (b. March 28, 1945), and Mary Barbara (b. Nov. 1, 1946) (McKellar) Bulman-Fleming. During World War II he served with the Royal Canadian Navy, in the Directorate of Operational Research. In 1940, McKellar made the first detection of molecular matter in the interstellar medium, identifying the spectrum of the organic compounds cyanogen (\"CN\") and methyne. (\"CH\"). The following year, his analysis of the spectra of the cyanogen molecules showed that the surrounding space was very cold with a temperature of approximately -271 °C. At the time, the significance of this was not appreciated; the distinguished Canadian chemist and future Nobel Laureate Gerhard Herzberg said that the temperature measurement \"...has of course a very restricted meaning\". Almost 25 years later Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson detected microwave radiation coming from all regions of the sky corresponding to the same temperature of -271 °C found by McKellar, thus revealing its ubiquity and relation to the radiation left over from the Big Bang. McKellar's early death, after a prolonged illness, in 1960 precluded him from consideration for the Nobel Prize awarded to Penzias and Wilson in 1978. Following the war, from 1952 until 1953, he was visiting professor at the University of Toronto department of physics. Between 1956 and 1958 he served as president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, then in 1959 he became president of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada for a year. He continued working at the DAO up until four days before he died in Victoria, British Columbia from complications due to lymphoma contracted during his service in the Navy during the War. He was noted for his work in molecular spectroscopy. Among his contributions was the first estimation of the temperature of interstellar gas (and therefore deep space) as 2.4° K based on the excitation of CN doublet lines, and finding evidence for the carbon-nitrogen nuclear cycle as the energy source for carbon stars. (The temperature estimate was subsequently confirmed with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which has a measured temperature of 2.725 °K.) During his career he was the author (or co-author) of 73 scientific publications. \n",

      "Matilde \"Matti\" Herrera Bower is a Cuban-American politician and retired dental assistant. Bower has been elected to three two-year terms as the Mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, beginning in 2007. Most recently, because of a loophole in the term limits rule, Bower was able to run for an open commission seat, but lost by a considerably large margin in the run-off race against retired banker, Joy Malakoff .Bower won re-election to her third and final term as mayor on November 1, 2011. She is the first woman, as well as the first Hispanic, to serve as Mayor of Miami Beach. She is a Democrat, though Miami Beach elections are nonpartisan. Bower was born in Cuba and immigrated to the United States. She attended Miami Technical High School and became a dental assistant. Bower also spent decades as a local activist and preservationist, including advocacy for the successful preservation of the Miami Beach Architectural District. Bower served as a Miami Beach city commissioner from 1999 to 2007 before being elected mayor of the South Florida city in 2007. She won re-election to a second term in 2009. The city of Miami Beach received a bond rating upgrade in 2010 and saw a balanced budget that same year under Bower. However, pension costs have risen to more than $50 million in 2011, up from just $3.5 million in 2000. She has also dealt with controversy surrounding Urban Beach Week. In 2011, Bower announced her re-election campaign for a third, and final, term as Mayor of Miami Beach. (Mayors are term limited to three, two-year terms in office). Bower, who was 72 years old in November 2011, faced three opponents in the election: comedian Steve Berke, entrepreneur Dave Crystal, and public relations practitioner Laura Rivero Levey. Bower was easily re-elected to a third term on November 1, 2011. She won 59.4% of the popular vote, or 4, 103 votes. Her closest opponent, comedian and Yale University graduate Steve Berke, garnered 23.38%, or 1, 614. Matti Herrera Bower was sworn into her third mayoral term on November 2, 2011. Bower ran for the Miami Beach Commission Group 3 seat in 2013, but lost to Joy Malakoff, garnering 2, 641 votes (40.27%) to Malakoff's 4, 214 votes (59.73%). \n",

      "The Seven Isles neighborhood comprises 315 households, with approximately 1, 145 residents, and is situated north of Las Olas Boulevard. The Intracoastal Waterway borders the east and north boundaries, while the neighborhoods of Sunrise Key and Sunrise Intracoastal are to the north, the neighborhood of Central Beach is east of it, the neighborhoods of Idlewyld and Riviera Isles are to the south, Las Olas Isles is located southwest of it, and the neighborhood to the west of the Intracoastal Waterway is Nurmi Isles. There are nine streets within the Seven Isles: Aqua Vista Boulevard, Barcelona Drive, Castilla Isle, Del Mar Place, De Sota Drive, De Sota Terrace, Pelican Isle, Sea Island Drive and Seven Isles Drive. W.F. Morang arrived in Fort Lauderdale from Boston in the early 1920s and participated with other developers in the land boom era of 1923 to 1926. His company, W.F. Morang & Sons, Inc., helped develop and dredge some of the finger islands around the city including the currently called the Seven Isles. Within these , his first projects included Rio Vista Isles where he dredged canals and built roads and bridges before dredging the area north of Las Olas Boulevard, which back then was called \"Lauderdale Isles\" (not to be confused with the present-day Lauderdale Isles neighborhood across from Riverland Village, ) which included the isles of Aqua Vista, Barcelona, De Sota, Sea Island and Pelican Isle, as well as \"Lauderdale Shores\" (which includes Castilla and Del Mar). The names of the seven isles are Aqua Vista (which means \"Water View\" in Latin, ) Barcelona (after the city in Spain, ) Castilla (a feminine noun of the Spanish word \"Castle\" or \"Castillo, \") Del Mar (which means \"Of the Sea, \" in Spanish, ) De Sota (which is a feminine form of the Spanish conquistador, Hernando De Soto's last name, ) Pelican Isle, and Sea Island. Though Morang built no homes and never completed the project, he began the building of a hotel. The Croissantania, at the eastern end of Aqua Vista Boulevard. The hotel had foundation work and walls, but construction was halted due to a material shortage which affected all of Southeast Florida after a steel yacht called the Prinz Valdemar, reputedly owned by German Kaiser Wilhelm I, mysteriously sank across the mouth of the harbor of Miami (present-day Port of Miami.) This disaster shut off the major entry source of building materials for this project. The venture ended with the disastrous September 17, 1926 hurricane. The plans to dig Port Everglades were drawn and approved in 1926 due to the shutdown of Miami's harbor, but it was many years until the port was put into use. As part of the promotion for the sale of the then named \"Lauderdale Isles-Lauderdale Shores, \" Morang erected massive twin columns based on two pedestals as a gateway to his development. The pedestals were set approximately apart and the columns extended skyward some forty feet. They were aligned on either side of a long canal giving maximum visual effect to someone standing on East Las Olas Boulevard and looking due north. At the north side of the seawall between the columns, a boat dock ramp was constructed and Mr. Morang hired a boat captain to conduct free sightseeing tours to prospective buyers. The Florida land boom era came to an end after the September 1926 hurricane, which did extensive damage to Fort Lauderdale and toppled the twin columns on East Las Olas Boulevard. Only the most easterly pedestal remains where it has sat on its original site since being built in 1925. During the East Las Olas road renovation of 1995, the pedestal was slated for demolition. A resident of Seven Isles, Diane Hess, petitioned the City to save the structure, initiated a campaign to obtain its historic designation status and raised funds (including a matching grant from the State of Florida) to preserve and conserve the pedestal. The surviving pedestal stands west of Seven Isles Drive. The original plats for the development subdivided the into lots. Between 1928 and 1937, the lots were re-platted and consolidated into acreage. Between 1937 and 1952, the land was again re-platted and the acreage converted back into individual lots. These lots encompassed a variety of widths: most in excess of , many over . With the exception of one, all the original lots were either re-platted into bigger lots, or through land sales, were merged with adjacent lots. Seven Isles Drive was originally called Southeast 23rd from East Las Olas Boulevard to Pelican Drive where, at that point – for the city's demarcation for areas N.E. and S.E. Broward Boulevard – it became Northeast 23rd Avenue. In 1986, the neighborhood, through the efforts of a hard-working, industrious resident, formed the Seven Isles Homeowners’ Association. The Association had the name of 23rd Avenue changed to Seven Isles Drive. With a majority of residents making a significant contribution, the guardhouse was designed by a resident of Seven Islands and then built. The Seven Isles Security Fund, Inc., was incorporated and became separate from the Seven Isles Homeowners' Association. The Seven Isles Homeowners’ Association was later dissolved by the Board of Directors and the by-laws rewritten to combine the Homeowners’ Association and the Security Fund under the name of the Seven Isles Security Fund, Inc. However, due to recent growth in the Seven Isles and thus the broadening scope or supervisory responsibilities – security, capital improvements and aesthetics – the name was amended in 2000 to reflect the larger breadth of duties. The Seven Isles Homeowners’ Association is now the sole body overseeing the community’s needs. \n",

      "Esteban \"Steve\" Jordan (February 23, 1939 – August 13, 2010) was a jazz, rock, blues, conjunto and Tejano musician from the United States. He was also known as \"El Parche\", \"The Jimi Hendrix of the accordion\", and \"the accordion wizard\". An accomplished musician, he played 35 different instruments. Born in Elsa, Texas to migrant farm workers and partially blinded as an infant, Jordan was unable to work in the fields. Left at home, he found friendship and guidance among the elderly. At a very young age he was introduced to music, especially the accordion. At the time, the musician Valerio Longoria followed the community of migrant farm workers and played for them in the labor camps. These circumstances brought the two together and the young Esteban mastered the instrument quickly. While he remained close to his traditional conjunto roots, he never limited himself musically. More than any other accordionist, Jordan pushed the diatonic accordion to its limits, both musically and physically, playing traditional conjunto, rock, jazz, salsa, zydeco and more. Jordan kept abreast of technological developments, using devices such as phase shifters, fuzzboxes, Echoplexes, for which he named a song, \"La Polka Plex\", and synthesizers, and was one of the few conjunto musicians to weave styles such as fusion jazz and rock into his music. He had also recorded country, western and mambo numbers. Members of his family frequently backed him up, including his sons Esteban Jr., Esteban III, and Ricardo. Esteban III (guitar) and Ricardo (bass) accompanied Esteban on-stage and in studio recording. Esteban established his own record label \"Jordan Records, Inc.\" on his birthday Feb. 23, 2010. He released one of his nine albums named Carta Espiritual (a spiritual letter), on which he had spent over 15 years recording new music, still yet to be released on his recording label. His sons Esteban Jr., Esteban III, and Ricardo continue his musical legacy. His sons go by \"El Rio Jordan de Esteban Jordan\" Rio Jordan, the band name given by their father. In 1988 while performing The Berlin Jazz Festival '88, Hohner invited Steve to the Hohner factory in Trossingen. The Hohner company and Steve collaborated in making a new accordion with Steve's specifications that included his own tuning, octaves, and tuning arrangement changes to the accidentals. It would enable Steve to do the music patterns he is famous for. In 2009, Hohner USA in recognition of Steve's contribution and accomplishments to the music world, Hohner launched the Steve Jordan \"Rockordeon\", a signature series accordion reissued in his honor. Jordan played with guitar legend Carlos Santana a number of times. New wave polka bands such as Brave Combo have cited Jordan's influence. In 1987 he was nominated for a Grammy, but lost out to his old friend Flaco Jiménez. His bid for mainstream presence continued in 1986 when he was asked to do the soundtrack for the Cheech Marin film Born in East L.A. He appeared in the film Texas Conjunto: Música de la gente, a documentary about Texas conjunto music, and in True Stories, an American musical film directed by and starring musician David Byrne. He did the music and appeared as an accordion street player in the film Born in East L.A. starring Cheech Marin. Esteban was inducted to the South Texas Conjunto Music Hall Of Fame on May 27, 2001. Also the National Hispanic Music Hall Of Fame in 2003. Esteban had cancer for four years and died of complications from liver cancer on August 13, 2010. He was 71. \n",
